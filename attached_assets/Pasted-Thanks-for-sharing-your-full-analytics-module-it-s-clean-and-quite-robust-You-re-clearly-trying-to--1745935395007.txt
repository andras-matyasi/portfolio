Thanks for sharing your full analytics module‚Äîit‚Äôs clean and quite robust. You're clearly trying to handle edge cases, which is great. The issue seems to lie not in this file per se, but rather in how and when you're calling trackPageView or trackEvent from your app.

Let‚Äôs go through the key issues and next steps:

‚úÖ 1. Google Analytics Script is Loading
You're injecting the GA4 script in index.html, and your gtag logic assumes it's present.

But: Are you calling any of the tracking functions like trackPageView(...) anywhere after routing changes?

‚ùå 2. No automatic SPA tracking
GA4 doesn't track route changes in SPAs automatically.

Your index.html loads the GA config once, but subsequent route changes (e.g. React Router) won't trigger events unless you manually call trackPageView(...).

‚úÖ 3. You already have trackPageView()
Perfect. You just need to wire it into your React routing logic.

‚úÖ 4. How to fix this (React Router example)
Add this hook to your app:

ts
Copy
Edit
// useAnalytics.ts
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';
import AnalyticsService from './path-to-your-analytics-service';

const useAnalytics = () => {
  const location = useLocation();

  useEffect(() => {
    AnalyticsService.trackPageView(location.pathname);
  }, [location]);
};

export default useAnalytics;
Then call this once inside your main component (e.g., App.tsx):

tsx
Copy
Edit
import useAnalytics from './hooks/useAnalytics';

function App() {
  useAnalytics();
  return (
    // your routes
  );
}
‚úÖ 5. Sanity Check: Event Test
In any button click or other interaction, try this:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<button onClick={() => AnalyticsService.trackEvent('button_click', { label: 'My CTA' })}>
  Test GA Event
</button>
Check the GA DebugView to confirm it's firing.

üîç 6. Use DebugView in Google Analytics
Go to:

Google Analytics > Admin > DebugView (under Property section)

Use Chrome extension ‚ÄúGA4 Debugger‚Äù or enable debug mode via gtag('config', 'G-XXXX', { debug_mode: true })

üßº 7. Optional cleanup / optimization suggestions
Consider moving the GA script injection logic fully to your analytics.ts to reduce coupling with index.html

For advanced usage, you might want to queue events if GA isn't ready

‚úÖ Summary
You‚Äôve got 90% of the infrastructure right. What‚Äôs missing:

Call trackPageView() on every route change (SPA = no auto-tracking).

Optionally test trackEvent() manually to confirm it works.

Use GA DebugView to validate real-time events.
